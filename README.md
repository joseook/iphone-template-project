## üîß Advanced Customization

### Configuring 3D Models

#### iPhone
The iPhone 3D model is loaded from a GLB file (`/public/models/scene.glb`). The model supports color customization through material manipulation.

#### MacBook
Currently, the MacBook is rendered using primitive geometry. To use a real 3D model:

1. Acquire or create a MacBook 3D model in GLB format
2. Place the file in `/public/models/macbook.glb`
3. Update the `MacBook.jsx` component to load and render the model:

```jsx
// In MacBook.jsx
import { useGLTF } from '@react-three/drei';
import { useEffect } from 'react';

export default function MacBook(props) {
  const { nodes, materials } = useGLTF('/models/macbook.glb');
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Code to toggle colors
    // ...
  }, [props.item.color]);

  return (
    <group {...props} dispose={null}>
      {/* Reference the nodes and materials from the 3D model */}
      <mesh geometry={nodes.Body.geometry} material={materials.Body} />
      <mesh geometry={nodes.Screen.geometry} material={materials.Screen} />
      {/* ... */}
    </group>
  );
}

// Preload the model for better performance
useGLTF.preload('/models/macbook.glb');
```

### Performance Optimization

For better performance:

1. Use compressed textures where possible
2. Optimize 3D models by reducing polygon count
3. Implement lazy loading for components and assets
4. Use React.memo for components that don't need frequent re-renders
5. Implement code splitting with React.lazy and Suspense
